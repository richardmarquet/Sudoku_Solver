# Sudoku_Solver
This is a sudoku solver using PThreads in C

This program takes one paramter which is the grid itself, just pass in any 9x9 grid to make this work. 
There are two provided files. The first should be valid the second should be invalid. 

To compile this program
gcc -pthread -o sodoku_solver sodoku_solver.c

To run the program (grid1 can be replaced by grid)
./sodoku_solver grid1

These grid files were provided by my class professor and not made by me!
